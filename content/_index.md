# General Information

This is the course website for **STAT 7200: Multivariate Statistics**. This course aims to provide students with a broad overview of techniques used in multivariate statistical analysis, with an emphasis on *Multivariate Linear Regression* and *Principal Component Analysis*. At the end of the course, students will be able to

  - make decisions on how and when to use the techniques discussed in class;
  - apply and assess multivariate methods on real data;
  - make sound statistical conclusions based on a multivariate analysis.

Moreover, the course aims to make students familiar, or competent, with the `R` statistical software.

## Prerequisites

Consent of the instructor. Good knowledge of linear algebra and mathematical statistics is required.

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this class. If you are looking for a good reference, I recommend:

  - Anderson, *An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis*. Wiley (2003).
  - Muirhead, *Aspects of Multivariate Statistical Theory*. Wiley (2005).
  - Johnson & Wichern, *Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis*. Prentice Hall (2007).

## Assessments

The assessments for this course include:

  - Three (3) assignments;
  - One (1) midterm test;
  - One (1) final project, which includes a written report and an oral presentation.
<!--    + The guidelines for the term project can be found [here](stat7200-term_project-guidelines.pdf).-->
  
In particular, there is **no final exam**.

# Outline of Topics

The course is expected to cover the following topics:

  1. *Aspects of multivariate analysis*: handling multivariate data, graphical displays, statistical distance
  2. *Matrix algebra and random vectors*: eigenvalues and eigenvectors, positive definite matrices, mean vectors, covariance matrices and matrix decompositions
  3. *Random Samples*: sample geometry, characterizing random samples
  4. *Multivariate normal distribution*: definition and properties, estimation and sampling distributions
  5. *Inferences about a mean vector*: Hotelling's T<sup>2</sup> and likelihood ratio tests, confidence regions and multiple comparisons
  6. *Multivariate linear regression*: multivariate analysis of variance, least squares estimation and inference
  7. *Principal Component Analysis*: interpretation and use of principal components
  8. *Factor Analysis*: orthogonal factor model, estimation and inference
  9. *Canonical Correlation Analysis*: canonical variables and canonical correlations
  10. Graphical models (if time permits)

# Statistical Software

The course will make use of the R statistical software for demonstrating some of the theoretical concepts. Sample codes will be provided to students. 

You can download R for free (for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Solaris) from the *Comprehensive R Archive Network* at: https://cran.r-project.org/

For additional resources on R, see [here]({{< ref "suppl.md" >}}).
