# General Information

This is the course website for **STAT 7200: Multivariate Statistics**. This course aims to provide students with a broad overview of techniques used in multivariate statistical analysis, with an emphasis on *Multivariate Linear Regression* and *Principal Component Analysis*. At the end of the course, students will be able to

  - make decisions on how and when to use the techniques discussed in class;
  - apply and assess multivariate methods on real data;
  - make sound statistical conclusions based on a multivariate analysis.

Moreover, the course aims to make students familiar, or competent, with the `R` statistical software.
